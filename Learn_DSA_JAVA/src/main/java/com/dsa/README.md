# Data Structures and Algorithms (In My Words)

## 🔐 HashTable

- **Hash tables** are an essential data structure for solving a wide range of problems due to their efficient average time complexity for:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Lookup  
  (Typically **O(1)** time complexity)

- A **Hash Table** is essentially the same as a **HashMap** — the terms are often used interchangeably.
